For creating GUI I have used PyQt along with Qt designer .Qt designer makes creating a page design and getting it's code very easy.

The game has a fixed window size with pixel themed graphics on buttons and also for result.
The menubar has Option tab. In Option there are 2 options Restart and Quit. Both these options can be used by going to option tab and clicking on them or by using keyboard shortcuts.
